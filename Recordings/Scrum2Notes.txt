9/19 Scrum Meeting 2 Notes
Confirmed that standup notes are being taken and posted in chat
Discussed whether team norms should be in GitHub or just the deliverable (decided Appendix B in PDF is sufficient); signatures added as names at bottom
Appendix A being filled with individual contributions (six tasks per member)
Missing pieces: automated tests and input validation; JUnit considered but not strictly required, team leaning toward using it
Screencasts clarified:
Technical explanation of code
Walkthrough of code execution
Planning and division of work (all members must present)
Testing demonstration
Agreed to finish input validation and automated tests by tomorrow or Sunday
Third screencast (team planning) recorded together during meeting; remaining screencasts assigned to individuals
GitHub code confirmed as up-to-date; members sharing work via repo and Discord if needed
Team comfortable finalizing asynchronously in chat after todayâ€™s joint recording
